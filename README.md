# Demographic-Data-Analyzer

I'm using this project to practice my Python and Pandas skills with the provided dataset.

## Task

I will create a `demographic_data_analyzer.py` script that will:

1. Load and analyze the given demographic data.
2. Answer the following questions:
   - How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels.
   - What is the average age of men?
   - What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
   - What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
   - What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
   - What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
   - What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
   - What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
   - Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are included in `test_module.py` to verify the accuracy of the analysis functions. These tests check the functions' outputs against expected results for various inputs, ensuring correctness and proper error handling.
